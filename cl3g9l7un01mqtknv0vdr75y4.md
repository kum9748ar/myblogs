## Top 6 opensource repositories to learn JavaScript in 2022

## Intro 

Almost 95% of websites require javascript, it is one of the most popular programming languages that can help you make at least** $100000 **a year. And the browsers we use in daily life also require a javascript engine like `v8` is used by **Google chrome**, `Spider Monkey` by **Mozilla**, and `JavaScript Core` by **Safari**. So looking upon the popularity of JavaScript I thought about writing an article that will help everyone to learn javascript. I will be talking about authentic opensource repositories  which means everything is **free & free!** All you need is a **github** account

## 2. Write clean write better

Ok now let's assume that you have won the fight with Data Structures and algorithms then it comes to formatting our code.
